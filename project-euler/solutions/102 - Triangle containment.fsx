(*
Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, 
for which -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:
A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)
X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, 
whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using triangles.txt a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of
 one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for 
 which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in 
the example given above.
