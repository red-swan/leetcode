(*
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one 
possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations 
are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The 
lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012   021   102   120   201   210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8 and 9?

Takeaways:
----------
- again, constructing the answer is faster than constucting all answers and 
  searching for the right one
- the ordering allows us to know which ones come next and 'seek ahead' to 
  construct the answer
