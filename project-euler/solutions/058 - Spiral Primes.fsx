//Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, 
//a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

//37 36 35 34 33 32 31
//38 17 16 15 14 13 30
//39 18  5  4  3 12 29
//40 19  6  1  2 11 28
//41 20  7  8  9 10 27
//42 21 22 23 24 25 26
//43 44 45 46 47 48 49
//
//It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom 
//right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 
//numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.
//
//If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square 
//spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, 
//what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes 
//along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
