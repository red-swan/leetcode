(*2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?*)


let integers = 
    let rec nextint x= seq { yield x; yield! nextint (x+1)}
    nextint 1
let answer = Seq.find (fun x-> (x%11 = 0) && (x%13 = 0) && (x%14 = 0) && (x%15 = 0) && (x%16 = 0) && (x%17 = 0) && (x%18 = 0) && (x%19 = 0) && (x%20 = 0)) integers

// IMPROVEMENTS
// This is a SLOOOOOW, brute force method. No analytical effort put in.
