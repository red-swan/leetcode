# Project-Euler-Solutions
Working through Project Euler problems generally one at a time. 
Usually the code has a bottom section full of scratch so don't go copying and pasting everything.

This repo was originally done in F# 3.0 and I've tried updating them to today's F# 9.0 but I have not fixed them all.
